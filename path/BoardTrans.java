/*
 * First assignment for the Path Planning part of the Robotics practical.
 *
 * You'll be introduced to the problem of planning a path for the 
 * gripper of the robot arm. You will write some functions which are essential
 * for this task.
 *
 * The assignment consists of three parts:
 * - access some data of the board to get acquainted with it
 * - write a class to convert positions ("e3") to locations (column 4, row 2)
 * - write a function convert locations to cartesian coordinates (x,y,z)
 *
 * Just start reading the comments and fill in the ???? stuff. The latter two
 * parts of the assignment and the data are contained in separate class called
 * StudentBoardTrans, check the bottom of this file.
 * A pointer to documentation can be found in
 * /opt/stud/robotics/hints/DOCUMENTATION .
 *
 * You can test your answers yourself, if they are correct ask one of the
 * practical assistents to verify them.
 *
 * This Java introduction was written for the 2001/2002 course.
